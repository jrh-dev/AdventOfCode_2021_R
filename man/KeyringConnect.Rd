\title{Connect to an ODBC DBMS with credentials retrieved from the system
credential store using the {keyring} package.}
\usage{
KeyringConnect(keyring_name = NULL, service_name = NULL, dsn)
}
\arguments{
\item{keyring_name}{Character vector specifying the name of the keyring to be
used. Value can be NULL, in which case the system default keyring will be
used.}

\item{service_name}{Character vector specifying the service name of the key
to be used.}

\item{dsn}{Character string specifying the data source name. The names of
data sources available to the user can be retrieved using the
\code{ListDataSources()} function.}
}
\description{
Wrapper for \code{odbc::dbconnect()}, designed to make connecting to
an ODBC DBMS as simple as possible whilst using credentials retrieved from
the system credential store using the {keyring} package. Can be used in a
non-interactive R session.

The function does not handle keyring unlocking. When used in an interactive
session the user will be prompted to enter the keyring password. Otherwise,
appropriate code should be executed to unlock the keyring before calling the
function.

The system default keyring can be used, or any other named keyring. A key is
defined by a service name and a password, however, an additional "username"
variable can also be stored and is required by this function.

For users looking to enter credential manually, please see \code{Connect()}.
